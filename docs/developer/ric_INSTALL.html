Program E
An AIML compliant chat bot written using PHP and MySQL.
Paul Rydell 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Known bugs
Matching of multiple consecutive wildcards *'s and _'s can slow down performance 
significantly if there are more than 3-4 in a row. Try compressing consecutive 
wildcards into single wildcards.
Matching *'s in conditions might not work perfectly.
Use only the startup.xml that comes with Program E as a starting point for your 
startup.xml file.
If you are getting an error about &quot;get_defined_functions&quot; then comment out line 
565 in util.php. After you do that custom tags cannot be defined.



Installation Instructions 

-1. If you have a previous version of Program E delete all of its files and wipe 
    its database.

0. Prerequisites: PHP (4.0.4+) compiled --with-mysql and --with-xml and a recent 
   version of MySQL 3.23.xx and Apache. PHP version 4.2.2 recommended.

1. Unzip all the files into a web directory. 

2. Create a database for the program to use in MySQL.

3. Create the tables in the new database using db.sql which is in the sql 
   directory.

4. By default, AIML files and startup.xml are in the aiml directory. Use the 
   startup.xml file included in the distribution -- do not use the startup.xml 
   you get with AIML files from alicebot.org. AIML files that work well with 
   Program E can be found at 
   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=43190

5. Edit dbprefs.php with your database information and aiml directory information. 
   If you left your AIML files in the default directory you do not have to change 
   this. See dbprefs.php for other options you can configure.

6. The src/admin directory must be writable by the web server because botloader.php 
   will attempt to create a file subs.inc. Or you can also create an empty subs.inc 
   file and make it writable.

7. From your web browser, access botloader.php (in src/admin directory) to load the 
   AIML into the database. This might take a few minutes (On a dual PIII it takes 
   approx. 1 minute for 10,000 categories). If your PHP is running in safe mode you 
   might need to use botloaderinc.php to load the AIML files one at a time. 
   IMPORTANT NOTE: Whenever botloader.php is loaded it deletes all the existing 
   patterns/templates in the database and then loads them from the AIML files.

8. Access talk.html from your web browser and say something to the bot.

9. Or access jsrschat.html in the jsrs directory from your web browser and say 
   something to the bot.

10. Password protect your admin directory with a .htaccess file so no one can mess 
    around with reloading your bot.
